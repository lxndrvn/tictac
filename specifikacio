Tic-Tac-Toe is a board-game. 
First, the game is welcoming you.
Second, you can choose single (playing against the computer) or multiplayer mode (play with your friend).
Press 1 is the single mode, press 2 is the multiplayer. 
At this part of the game, if you would like to exit from the game, 
just press any key (now there is a bug here, we are planning to fix.)

Gameplay:

SINGLE MODE
In the single mode at this moment your character is always be the "X" and the computer's is the "O".
The board is divided into 3x3 squares can be occupied by one icon. 
You have to press a spot with numbers on the keyboard (1-9). 
The first turn is yours, after the computer selects a spot randomly.
If three icons of same type appear in a row either vertically or horizontally or diagonally, 
the user of that icon will be declared the winner by the program.
If all the squares of the board are filled and no user is the winner then the game is stop by the system (now there is a bug here,because nothing happened when the board is full, we working on it). 

MULTIPLAYER MODE

The rules are the same like in the single mode. The first player is the X, the second player is the O.
After player X select a spot, player O is the next, and so on...

Improvements: 
step 1) choosing a character
step 2) X or O start the game (random)
step 4) improve the tie ended 
step 5) is add sound
step 6) better design (i.e. using colours)
